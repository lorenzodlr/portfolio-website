            <p><br />I'm Lorenzo, as you can tell from the logo and the domain name, and I am freelancing as a web developer.</p>
            <p>I've been coding and programming for about five years but I've only recently started my web development career a year ago. I had a business idea I needed to make a full-stack application for(still in development), and that is how I started developing websites. I didn't think I would do it as a freelance service at the time, but I've found I really like it so here we are.</p>
            <p>I also really enjoy meeting new people and talking about their ideas. People are so unique as individuals and I get really intrigued with their creativity. I feel like we don't get to use that creativity enough as humans and that's something I want to move away from so I do my best to create an environment for my clients that allows them to express themselves with freedom. While it may just be a website to most, I see it as an extension of someone's(or a company's) identity that reveals a certain level of truth in them; a level of truth a lot of people will appreciate being shared.</p>
            <p><br />I encourage you to reach out to me for any and all questions or concerns. I would love to work on your next project :)</p>
